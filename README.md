Visualizing Cosmetic Claim Probabilities with NLP-powered Dash App


This project was developed as part of my end-of-studies internship, aiming to delve into the exciting intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and cosmetic industry. The repository hosts the code for a dynamic Dash web application that helps users to gain insights into cosmetic product ingredients and their associated probabilities of various cosmetic claims.

The models (logistic regression) have been trained and imported as pickled files, alongside the ingredient vectorizer. Unfortunately, the pickled files cannot be shared due to confidentiality constraints, and the accompanying data also remains confidential.
